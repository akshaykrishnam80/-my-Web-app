      MoJO 90* was created by me. Due to the keen interest in
      technological field I took Computer Science at Middlesex University.Iam studying there from the<br>
      last one year. Most Importantly,this is My first project I have ever done in my life. As a future Developer, I
      dedicated my max for this project,meanwhile, I <br>learned challenging tricks working via this. This is
      just a trial project. In coming years,I will develop different version of this MoJO 90*
      and will be launched <br>into world Giants.
